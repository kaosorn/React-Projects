# T Shirt Store
* -Built with: React/js, MongoDB *

A project I started to learn more about react and how to use it with mongoDB. I was going to use bootstrap or tailwindcss, but figured I should keep it basic css, so I used styled components. 

This project is not currently done, I am working on adding fabric.js for designing the shirts, and connecting it to mongoDB. For now, the shirts are displayed from a file of objects with an img url, description, quantity, and price.
